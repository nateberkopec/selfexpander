    <h1>The Self-Expander</h1>
    <p>
      "Some of the greatest joys in my life are the things I used to hate,
      or know nothing about, and now have grown to love.
      <br><br>
      So I thought: Instead of letting it happen accidently or randomly, why not
      be deliberate about it?"
      <br><br>

    <h2>What is the Self-Expander?</h2>
    <p>
      The Self-Expander suggests a random
      <a href="https://www.veryshortintroductions.com">Very Short Introduction</a>
      or a <a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/">Great Course</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inspired by Derek Sivers' post, linked above, about expanding one's
      horizons by learning about things you may not have any interest in. Thus,
      <b>you may only use the Self-Expander once per week</b>, to encourage you to
      actually experience the randomness and not simply use the Self-Expander
      until you find a topic you are already interested in.
